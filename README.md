# Module 22 Overview:
In this module, I utilized SparkSQL to analyze key metrics related to home sales data. The tasks included creating temporary views, partitioning the data, caching and uncaching a temporary table, and confirming that the table was successfully uncached.

> Key Insights:

* Calculated the average sale price of four-bedroom homes for each year.

* Determined the average price of homes built each year that have three bedrooms and three bathrooms.

* Analyzed the average price of homes built each year with three bedrooms, three bathrooms, two floors, and at least 2,000 square feet.

* Found the average price of homes by "view" rating where the average home price is $350,000 or higher.

> Tools Used:

* Google Colab: Colab Notebook

* Additional Resources: QuickDBD, Google AI, ChatGPT for formatting help, UT Bootcamp examples, Stack Overflow, tutoring sessions, and TA support.
